### Project Description
Chick N Pick is a playful web-based app that helps groups randomly decide who gets the most prized piece of mandhi the chicken chest. Enter participant names, set the number of chest pieces available, and let the app randomly spin to select the lucky winners.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Sharing mandhi with friends always ends in a diplomatic crisis: who gets the juicy chest piece? Wars have started over less.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
An unnecessarily complex and animated randomizer that fairly assigns the best chicken parts ‚Äî because your dinner table deserves justice (and drama).
